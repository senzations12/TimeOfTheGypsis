<p>Branislav Nusic (1864 -- 1938) was a Serbian novelist, playwright,<br />
satirist, essayist and founder of modern rhetoric in Serbia of<br />
Aromanian descent. He also worked as a journalist and a civil servant.<br />
Born Alkibijad Nusa (Aromanian: Alchiviadi al Nusa) in Belgrade,<br />
Principality of Serbia to a well-off family, Nusic enjoyed the<br />
benefits of a privileged upbringing for only a brief time. His father<br />
djordje Nusa was a well known grain merchant of Cincar (Aromanian or<br />
Vlach) origin who lost his wealth shortly after his son's birth and<br />
was forced to move the family to Smederevo where young Alkibijad<br />
attended elementary school and first two grades of boarding school.<br />
During his teens, Nusa moved back to Belgrade where he graduated from<br />
boarding school. Upon turning 18 years of age, he legally changed his<br />
name to Branislav Nusic. In 1884, he graduated from the University of<br />
Belgrade's Law School. During his studies, he also spent a year in<br />
Graz, Austria-Hungary.</p>
