<p>Federico Fellini (1920 - 1993) was an Italian film director and<br />
scriptwriter. Known for a distinct style that blends fantasy and<br />
baroque images, he is considered one of the most influential<br />
filmmakers of the 20th century, and is widely revered. He won five<br />
Academy Awards and was nominated for 12 in a career that spanned over<br />
forty years.<br />
Fellini was born on January 20, 1920 to middle-class parents in<br />
Rimini, then a small town on the Adriatic Sea. His father, Urbano<br />
Fellini (1894-1956), born to a family of Romagnol peasants and small<br />
landholders from Gambettola, moved to Rome in 1915 as a baker<br />
apprenticed to the Pantanella pasta factory. His mother, Ida Barbiani<br />
(1896-1984), came from a bourgeois Catholic family of Roman merchants.<br />
Despite her family's vehement disapproval, she eloped with Urbano in<br />
1917 to live at his parents' home in Gambettola.[2] A civil marriage<br />
followed in 1918 with the religious ceremony held at Santa Maria<br />
Maggiore in Rome a year later. The couple settled in Rimini where<br />
Urbano became a traveling salesman and wholesale vendor. Fellini had<br />
two siblings: Riccardo (1921-1991), a documentary director for RAI<br />
Television, and Maria Maddalena (m. Fabbri; 1929-2002).</p>

<h1>Left or right you may choose. </h1>
<p>Left is little ku-ku bird behind the bars.<br />
Right is person that knows with words, one of old novel stars.<br />
You're just one step before your room. If you choose good I will stop talking,<br />
go left, if you feel like walking.</p>
