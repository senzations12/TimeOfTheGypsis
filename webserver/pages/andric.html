Ivan "Ivo" Andric (1892 - 1975) was a Yugoslav novelist, short story<br />
writer, and the 1961 winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature. His<br />
writings dealt mainly with life in his native Bosnia under the Ottoman<br />
Empire. His native house in Travnik has been transformed into a<br />
Museum, and his Belgrade flat on Andricev Venac hosts the Museum of<br />
Ivo Andric, and Ivo Andric Foundation.<br />
