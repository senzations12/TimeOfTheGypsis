<p>Saint Sava (1174 - 1236) was a Serbian Prince and Orthodox monk, the<br />
first Archbishop of the autocephalous Serbian Church, the founder of<br />
Serbian law and literature, and a diplomat. Sava was born Rastko<br />
Nemanjic, the youngest son of Serbian Grand Prince Stefan Nemanja<br />
(founder of the Nemanjic dynasty), and ruled the appanage of Hum<br />
briefly in 1190-1192. He became a monk in his youth, receiving the<br />
monastic name Sava (Sabbas), subsequently founding the monasteries of<br />
Hilandar on Mount Athos, and Zica. In 1219 he was recognized as the<br />
first Archbishop of Serbs, by the Patriarch of Constantinople, and in<br />
the same year he authored the oldest known constitution of Serbia,<br />
Zakonopravilo, thus securing full independence; both religious and<br />
political. Sava heavily influenced Serbian medieval literature.
